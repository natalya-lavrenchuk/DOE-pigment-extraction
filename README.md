# DOE-pigment-extraction
Design of Experiments (DOE) study using a three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design to optimize pigment extraction (betacyanin and betaxanthin) from pear fruit. Built response surface models in MATLAB and Minitab, performed ANOVA, and identified optimal conditions maximizing pigment yield.
